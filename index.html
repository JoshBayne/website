            <p>
                Cooking and being in the kitchen is a passion of mine. Given the chance, I'll cook for myself or other people 99 times out of 100. 
                My favorite cuisines to work with are Italian and Japanese, however I also greatly enjoy to make a variety of dishes from the African and European Continents.

            </p>
            <p>
                Gunpla, or Gundam Plastic Models, is the art of building and customizing the various model kits of the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise as produced by Bandai.
                It's a deeply rewarding hobby that flexes your creativity and hand eye coordination.
                In my spare time I can sometimes be found building new kits, trying to design custom color schemes for them or planning out dioramas. Currently I have 2 display cases full of kits,
                and will almost certainly be adding a third case fairly soon.

            <p>
                If I'm not making something to eat or working on a plastic model kit, I'll be found working on the various computer systems in my apartment. These include my Pi 4 powered Plex server,
                my PiZero W powered peephole camera, a Pi 4 powered Home Assistant build (which I have yet to finish the automations for), my Streaming/HTPC and my personal rig.

            As you might be able to tell from the specs of my personal PC, I enjoy to play video games as well. Normally I play on Steam with friends, but occaisionally I'll play
            games on PS4 and Xbox for the exclusives.
